📖 Portal Project Description

Portal is a dedicated space within Nicholas Tritsaris’ retro web collection that serves as a gateway to experiments, side projects, and creative explorations. Designed with the same nostalgic aesthetic as the main hub, Portal acts as a launchpad for new ideas and interactive content.

Key aspects of Portal:

    🔗 Gateway Function — Portal connects visitors to different projects, archives, and experimental pages in one place.

    🎮 Retro Theme — Styled with early‑2000s web design elements to match the nostalgic vibe of the main site.

    🧩 Exploration — Visitors can navigate through sub‑pages (like Portal Page 1, Portal Page 2, etc.) to discover unique content.

    🌐 Part of the Collection — Portal is integrated into the broader retro web ecosystem alongside projects like Net Atlas Ultimate, Net Observation Project, and MC Property Encyclopedia.
